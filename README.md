# 🚀 EventNest — Event Management & Multi-Vendor Marketplace

**EventNest** is a smart, unified event management ecosystem and multi-vendor marketplace developed by **Team Nexora** for the Sri Lankan market. It bridges the gap between event organizers, service providers, product suppliers, event management companies, and platform administrators.
---
 
## 🌟 Key Pillars & Features

- **Unified Marketplace:** Search, compare, and book verified event vendors (photographers, decorators, caterers, DJs, production teams) and purchase physical event supplies.
- **Event Budget Tracker (`/api/budget`):** Customer budget planning tool with category cost tracking and automatic expense synchronization from accepted bookings and product purchases.
- **Order & Inventory Management:** E-commerce shopping cart, stock auto-deduction, order tracking (`PENDING` → `PROCESSING` → `SHIPPED` → `DELIVERED`), and customer refund request workflows.
- **Booking & Availability System:** Real-time vendor calendar scheduling with slot availability validation and double-booking conflict prevention.
- **Escrow Financial Settlement (`/api/payments`):** Secure funds flow (`PENDING` → `HELD_IN_ESCROW` → `RELEASED` to vendor) supporting online payments and offline bank slip uploads with standard 10% platform fee.
- **Ratings & Moderation:** Verified 1–5 star reviews for services and event packages, vendor replies, reporting moderation queue, and admin content management.
- **Reporting & Exporting:** Vendor dashboard analytics with PDF export (`pdfkit`) and Excel export (`exceljs`).
